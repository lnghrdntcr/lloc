# Learning Lines with Comparative Constraints
## Behaviours
### MNIST Dataset
It orders the digits in buckets of 1/epsilon labels
### FEC Dataset
Orders facial expressions in buckets, and each bucket has mostly similar facial expressions (inaccurate due to the fact that the graph is not a tournament)

#### TODO: 
* Use correlation matrix instead of labels to create constraints for the mnist dataset
